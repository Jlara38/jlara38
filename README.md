### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Jose, I am interested in mobile app development and the usage of languages such as C and C++. Additionally, I enjoy being able to learn about and playing with new languages ex: SQL and Java. I tend to use Visual Studio Code, CLion, Android Studio, and IntelliJ for my coding needs. Currently trying to pick up Kotlin for a smoother experience in Android App Development.
